I woke up, feeling sleepy from the long previous night of homework.
After breakfast, I walked my dog Rocky and set off for the bus stop, hoping to get to school early enough to have some free time.
Once I arrived, I got my wish, and I was able to play on my tablet for a while until math class started.
Period after period eventually passed by until thye end of the day and luckily I didn't get too much work.
I sat through some interesting classes, we even got to watch a movie in AP Euro.
I came home from school and had a snack.
I walked Rocky again soon after and got my homework finished up.
After that I ate dinner while watching a movie and then went to bed.
